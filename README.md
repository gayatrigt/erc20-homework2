## Vulnerability 1: Freeze Bypass

### The Problem

The freezing mechanism can be bypassed due to incomplete checks in the `transferFrom` function.

- Only checks if the spender (`msg.sender`) is frozen
- Doesn't check if the token owner (`from`) is frozen
- A frozen account's tokens can still be moved if they previously approved a non-frozen address

### The Fix

```solidity
function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 amount) public override returns (bool) {
    require(!isFrozen[msg.sender] && !isFrozen[from], "account frozen");
    return super.transferFrom(from, to, amount);
}
```

## Vulnerability 2: Unauthorized Burning

### The Problem

The `burn` function has no access controls, allowing anyone to burn anyone else's tokens.

- No permission checks
- Anyone can burn tokens from any address
- Catastrophic loss of funds possible

### The Fix

```solidity
function burn(address from, uint256 amount) public {
    require(msg.sender == from || msg.sender == owner(), "not authorized");
    _burn(from, amount);
}
```

Best Practices Learned

1. **Access Control**: Always implement proper access controls on sensitive functions
2. **Complete Checks**: When implementing freezing or blocking mechanisms, ensure all relevant parties are checked
3. **Token Safety**: For functions that can destroy tokens, ensure only authorized parties can execute them
4. **Permission Validation**: Double-check both spender and owner permissions in transfer-related functions
